## üìÑ Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive financial analysis of HDFC Bank using structured SQL queries. The dataset includes Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow statements from FY 2016 to FY 2025. The purpose of the project is to derive meaningful insights about the bank's financial health and performance over the years. Key financial metrics such as revenue, profit, operating costs, margins, tax rates, and dividends are analyzed to support decision-making and data-driven storytelling in Power BI.

### üìä Objectives
- Create and manage a relational database schema with multiple financial tables.
- Extract, analyze, and compare yearly and quarterly financial trends.
- Calculate important financial ratios and performance indicators.
- Identify key growth trends, variance, and YoY comparisons.
- Prepare clean and aggregated datasets for Power BI visualizations.

### üîπ Highlights of the Project
- **Database Design**: Structured schema with 4 key tables: `PROFIT_LOSS_YEARLY`, `PROFIT_LOSS_QUATERLY`, `BALANCESHEET`, and `CASHFLOW`.
- **Data Analysis**: More than 25+ complex SQL queries written for:
  - Revenue, profit, and sales growth analysis
  - Cost structure and operational efficiency analysis
  - Ratio analysis: Profit margins, dividend payout, effective tax rate
  - Year-over-year (YoY) comparisons and trend evaluations
- **Power BI Ready**: Clean and optimized SQL outputs prepared for dashboard visualizations in Power BI.
- **Business Insights**: Financial performance tracking across years to support investment decisions, internal audits, or academic learning.

### üë®‚Äçüíº Tools Used
- **SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)** for data extraction, transformation, and querying.
- **Microsoft Excel** for initial data cleaning and formatting.
- **Power BI** for interactive visualization and dashboarding.
